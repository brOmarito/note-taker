# note-taker
The note-taker is an app that, well, takes notes! As of now, you can't edit the existing notes but you can create new ones and delete the existing ones.

## What's the Point?
The main reason of the application is to have somewhere for me to take notes. Another reason for the application was to give me an opportunity to work with both Express JavaScript and deploying to Heroku.

## Lessons Learned
One of the things that I learned the importance of was to resolve my API endpoints. This allows for the application to resolve one endpoint and move on to another. In this case, I needed to resolve the POST call to create a new Note and the DELETE call to delete a specific note so the app could move on and run the GET notes API call.

## Improvements
* I would like to add functionality to edit the existing notes
* I would also like to add functionality to delete multiple notes at once
* Finally, I want to consider adding user feedback
